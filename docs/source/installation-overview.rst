Use PIP to install all the requirements,::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt


.. _installation-script:

Installation Script
===================

You can install Newfies-Dialer manually or using the shell script provided.

To install Newfies-Dialer using this script,::

    $ chmod +x install/install-newfies.sh

    $ ./install/install-newfies.sh


.. _running-newfies-dialer:

Running Newfies-Dialer
========================

Inside Newfies-Dialer directory you should run::

    $ python manage.py syncdb

    $ python manage.py collectstatic

    $ python manage.py runserver


``syncdb`` will create a database named test.db in ``database`` folder of the
Newfies-Dialer directory. We have configured Newfies-Dialer to do this, but you
can change this simply by modifying settings.py where DATABASES dictionary is
constructed. You can find more information about this in the
Django documentation.

``collectstatic`` will fetch all necessary media files and put them into
``static`` folder defined in the settings module.

``runserver`` runs an embedded webserver to test your site.
By default it will run on http://localhost:8000. This is configurable and more
information can be found on ``runserver`` in Django documentation.


.. _caching-system:

Caching System
==============

When a User requests a page, the Web server makes calculations
for business logic and to create the page that your visitor sees.
It creates a processing overhead higher than a standard
read-a-file-off-the-filesystem server arrangement.

This is where caching comes in.

To cache something is to save the result of an expensive calculation so that
you donâ€™t have to perform the calculation next time::

    $ mkdir /usr/share/django_cache
