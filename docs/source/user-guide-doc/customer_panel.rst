.. _survey-app:

Survey
------

The survey application for Newfies-Dialer allows polls and surveys to be taken over the phone.

Each contact is called, and then played a sound file. After the sound file is heard, the user can
enter their answer through the phone keypad using keys 0 to 9.

Therefore before creating the survey, the first job is to upload the audio for the survey. One audio
file is required for each question.

**Uploading Audio Files**:

Select Audio Files from the top menu then click add.

Enter a name to describe the audio, then click chose file, select the file you require from your
computer, then click submit.

Note that only mp3, Wav and ogg formats are supported.

The audio file will then be uploaded and renamed so that it is unique.

**Create the Survey**:

**URL**:

    * http://localhost:8000/module/survey/
    * http://localhost:8000/module/survey/add/
    * http://localhost:8000/module/survey/1/

.. image:: ../_static/images/customer/survey_list.png


Select Modules from the top menu, then Survey.

Click the add button, then give the survey a name and description, then click Submit.

A button will now appear to add a question.

In the question field, put in some text to describe the question - e.g "What is 1+1"; select the audio
file pertaining to the question which was uploaded in the previous step.

If no audio file is selected, then the system will automatically play the text in the question field
using the text to speech engine.

Then click Add Response. A further two fields will appear named Key Digit and Key Value. In key Digit
put a number from 0 to 9 which should be pressed for this answer. In the example "What is 1+1", "2"
should be placed in the Key Digit Field"

The Key Value field is used in the survey reports, and so in this case, you would put "Correct" as
1+1=2. You may chose to add responses 0,1 and 3 to 9 as key digits, with key values of "Wrong" as
these answers will then be summed up in the Survey Reports.

You can then go on to add another question, and its associated responses. On completion, click
Update Survey.

To use the Survey in a campaign, simply create a campaign as normal, and select the Survey name in
the Application drop-down.

**Survey Results**

When the survey is complete, the survey results can be inspected by clicking Reporting on the top
and selecting Survey Results from the drop-down.
