Overview
========

Newfies-Dialer is an open source VoIP Dialer based on distributed message passing.
It has been built to support cloud servers and also works on standalone servers.
It uses Freeswitch (VoIP Server) to outbound calls, but support for other VoIP
Servers such as Asterisk could be easily added in the future. The platform is

brokers and workers.

Newfies-Dialer is a computerised system that automatically dials a group
of telephone numbers for connection to assigned campaigns.
